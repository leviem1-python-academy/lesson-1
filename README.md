## Lesson 1
### Before you start

#### Requirements
Please install the following software:

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)
- [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Python 3.11 (or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Downloading and opening the lesson
Please watch [this video]() for help with this section. 

1. Fork the repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions
3. Clone your forked repository
4. Open in PyCharm
5. Configure Python interpreter

### Printing (Python Output)
In python, we can print values using the `print()` function.

Here's an example of how to use it.
```python
print("Hello, world!")  # Output: Hello, world!
print(5)  # Output: 5
```

## Exercises

Please watch [this video]() for help with this section.

### Writing your code
Open the file named "__init__.py" in the "app" folder. This file will be where you
write the code for each exercise.

For this exercise, simply read the code in the file.

### Running the code
To run the code, open the "console" in PyCharm, then run the following command.
```shell
scripts/run
```

There will be a lot of junk on the screen, but you should see "Hello, world!" at the
bottom.

### Checking progress
Test check your work, run the following command.
```shell
scripts/check
```

There will be a lot of junk on the screen, but you should see "congratulations :)" at
the bottom. If there is something wrong with your code, you will see a description of
the problem instead.

### Uploading your work
Once you're finished, you can upload your to GitHub by committing your code and pushing
it in GitKraken. You can also double-check your work with the automatic GitHub Actions
checks.
